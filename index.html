    <p>Maclay Bridge is an old single lane bridge over the Bitterroot River west of Missoula. According to Historical
    Research Associates in a report for the South Avenue bridge project, in 1953 the bridge’s main truss section
    (called a Parker truss, pictured above) was salvaged from a Blackfoot River site and erected at the Maclay site.
    It was intended to replace part of a previous bridge that washed out in 1948. The old bridge now consists of 3
    piers in the river and 4 sections: the 1953 Parker truss, one pony truss, and two reinforced concrete spans
    erected in 1964, with many repairs over the years as parts wore out, washed out or failed. It is classified as
    functionally obsolete and fracture critical by the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) and Missoula
    County officials.</p>

    <p>Besides being a single lane bridge with accident clusters at the nearly 90 degree turn on the west end and a 45
    degree turn on the east, it has structural and stability problems due to its age, unknown foundations,
    vulnerability to floods, and deterioration. It has a very low sufficiency rating of 27.3 out of 100 and 98.3% of all
    Montana off-system bridges rate higher than it. In addition to its approaches violating State safety standards, the
    bridge is the site of many deaths and accidents. It’s old and its many parts are worn out including the deck of
    the bridge in which holes have sporadically appeared through which the river could be seen down below (see
    following photo). Due to the low clearance of the bridge, it is vulnerable to being washed out in the next 100
    year flood event.</p>

    <p>IMAGE</p>

    <p>Due to its bad configuration, the old bridge has caused ongoing environmental damage to the river channel and
    banks, including unnatural channel constriction and scour, bank erosion and sediment deposition. It is likely a
    legal liability to the County and an “attractive nuisance” due to the many diving and swimming accidents it
    invites.</p>

    <p>Two separate environmental studies completed by the State and County of bridge alternatives both
    recommended construction of a new bridge at a South Avenue river crossing over other options, including
    rehabilitating the old bridge. The 1994 and 2013 studies confirmed through detailed analyses that a new bridge
    would not create a bypass or attract more traffic. Instead, the new bridge would provide a shorter and much
    more efficient route that would reduce traffic impacts on 5 streets in the Target Range neighborhood (studies
    show North Ave., Clements, Woodlawn, Humble and River Pines Rd. would see reduced traffic with a South
    Avenue bridge). See following air photo. Most of the traffic crossing Maclay Bridge comes from or goes to
    South Avenue.</p>

    <p><img src="images/overview.jpg"></p>

    <p>Maclay Bridge is currently closed to school buses due to the weight limit placed on it by MDT and the unsafe
    conditions, therefore school children who live west of the river must ride to and from school by a much longer
    route every day. (See Missoulian article here at https://missoulian.com/news/local/mdt-maclay-bridge-unsafe-
    for-school-buses/article_69633f8a-7cf8-5584-aecd-7a9196b0c292.html). Emergency vehicles such as fire
    trucks are severely restricted in crossing the bridge which limits response times west of the river.</p>

    <p>Missoula County Commissioners voted unanimously in 2013 to ask the MDT to use Federal Gas Tax funds to
    replace the old single lane bridge with a new 2 lane bridge that would meet current and future needs and at a
    better site at South Avenue. They signed a formal project agreement in 2014. In 2015, the Commissioners again
    passed a unanimous resolution reaffirming commitment to the project. All commissioners since 1994 except
    Dave Strohmaier have supported the project.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Strohmaier as a newcomer in 2016 and apparently without having read the studies, displayed
    bias against the scientific reports done to that date and favored instead an opposition group, as reported and
    criticized by the Missoulian newspaper (see article here https://missoulian.com/opinion/editorial/time-for-
    missoula-county-to-build-bridges/article_e38ab82c-a437-5da0-9053-34c8b38279fe.html). See also this
    Missoulian article that reported on Strohmaier’s behavior: https://missoulian.com/news/local/missoula-county-
    constituents-upset-over-emails-forwarded-by-commissioner/article_00a06197-1e60-5713-9260-
    30d5dc9dfe8a.html</p>

    <p>MDT and FHWA informed Strohmaier that the county will lose the $12.5 to $14 million funds already allocated
    and would have to pay back $1 million spent to date if the Commissioners abandon the project. In addition,
    MDT and FHWA have made it very clear that they will not pay for rehab of the old Maclay Bridge for many
    legitimate regulatory, safety, environmental, and financial reasons. In addition HDR Engineering strongly
    defended its environmental and engineering studies (which are in addition to--and agree with--the 1994 and
    2013 studies) in its rebuttal to Strohmaier. As a result, Strohmaier and the other commissioners revised their
    stance and now appear to be allowing the project to proceed (https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/next-
    steps-for-south-avenue-bridge/article_75807f5b-e123-576c-9005-644f922e848a.html).</p>

<p>The South Avenue bridge project is a County-wide issue that all taxpayers should be concerned about. Clearly
it would better serve the County and save taxpayer’s money if Federal gas tax dollars were used to build a new
2 lane bridge in a better location instead of County taxpayers having to reimburse the State the $1million spent
so far and then pay County dollars to fix up an old decrepit single lane bridge in a lousy location. All County
taxpayers INCLUDING Missoula city residents will pay, likely through increased property taxes, if the
Commissioners don&#39;t proceed with the South Avenue project. Please email and/or phone the county
commissioners and let them know your thoughts.</p>

<b>Who we are:</b>
<br>
<i></i><p>The Bitterroot Bridges Coalition is an incorporated non-profit organization of Missoula County residents who
are responsible for this website. Our goal is to help the Missoula County Commissioners and the MDT identify
and apply common sense solutions to the real problems at Maclay Bridge such as advancing the South Avenue
bridge project and devising better management of public use of the lower Bitterroot river ecosystem.<p>

</p>We support a safe new attractive 2-lane bridge with a walkway at South Avenue that follows the scientific
recommendations of Montana licensed engineers employed by MDT and the County to meet the needs of the
county into the future and that addresses environmental and safety issues. We also support removal of the old
bridge due to its unsafe condition, the many environmental problems it causes, and the need for restoration of
the bed and banks of the river at that site.</p></i>

<blockquote>
Merv Eriksson March 29, 2019<br>
845 Wyoming, Suite 402<br>
Missoula, MT 59801<br>
<br>
Subject: Maclay Bridge/South Avenue Bridge<br>
<br>
Dear Commissioner Slotnick,<br>
<br>
I’ve tried to avoid getting involved with this issue since its recent re-emergence. Until 6 months ago, my wife
and I lived on Riding Ring Road, near the east end of the proposed South Avenue Bridge. My wife and I
enjoyed the peace and solitude of the area.<br>
<br>
However, I have been a professional bridge engineer for almost 44 years. I’ve worked for the Minnesota Dept.
of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, the US Forest Service and a Missoula bridge
engineering firm. I’ve designed, or approved the designs, of more than four hundred bridge replacements or
major rehabilitations. For the majority of those bridges I was employed by the transportation agency owning
those bridges. Therefore, I was involved in determining if they should be repaired or replaced. I was the primary
author of the publication Identifying and Preserving Historic Bridges. I know bridge management and historic
bridge rehabilitation, and I know the history of the Maclay Bridge.<br>
<br>
I avoided involvement because I didn’t believe that pouring more money into the existing Maclay Bridge could
possibly ever survive as a viable option. I knew that FHWA could not put money into a substandard bridge and
that private, County State and Federal specialists would strongly recommend replacement. And South Avenue
was easily the best location. I knew that would be the case when we built our home in 2008.<br>
<br>
With the answer so obvious, I didn’t want to alienate my friends and neighbors on South Avenue who had been
panicked by the efforts of MBA. Actually, I never felt like it was a big deal. The improved access provided by
the new bridge will offset the inconvenience of more traffic, provided speeds are kept down and South Avenue
from Humble Street west is upgraded. It never occurred to me that a small group of largely well meaning, but
narrowly focused citizens could so severely sidetrack a good project.<br>
<br>
I was involved with two bridge rehabilitations using the superimposed arch method endorsed by the MBA. In
both cases (Lucille Bridge in central Idaho and Hoyt Flats Bridge near Avery, Idaho) traffic volumes were very
low and single lane bridges were appropriate for these Forest Service roads.<br>
<br>
That is not the case at the Maclay Bridge. The current type and volume of traffic precludes the acceptability of a
single lane bridge, and this will only worsen as the bridge ages. Without getting too technical, the existing
bridge has many components, all of which are old and many are deteriorated.  Reinforcing the truss still
commits the County to continued maintenance. It’s like replacing the engine of an old Yugo. The engine may
run well but the wheels could fall off next year.<br>
<br>
There is always an environmental cost in building a new bridge. That doesn’t mean we stop building bridges.
The environmental reviews and requirements of both State and Federal government entities mitigate those
affects as much as is reasonable to expect. Building the new South Avenue Bridge will have far less negative
environmental effect than leaving the existing, under-spanned Maclay bridge in place.<br>
<br>
The Maclay Bridge most certainly does not have exceptional historic significance and what historic integrity it
has retained after having been moved and frequently repaired, would largely be lost by the imposition of the
arch in the rehabilitation. I don’t think anyone has a love for this bridge, other than as a red herring to prevent
construction of the new South Avenue Bridge.<br>
<br>
Your decision on letting this project move forward should not be a hard decision. The County either allows the
MDT and FHWA to construct a new bridge on South Avenue. Or, the County stops that action, repays $1.4
million to MDT and FHWA and tries to get by with a dysfunctional bridge across the Bitterroot River.<br>
<br>
The Super-imposed Arch Rehabilitation option will never be constructed, since no responsible government
entity will ever fund such a thing. FHWA cannot participate and MDT would want nothing to do with it.
Missoula County residents will stand up at some point and refuse to fund such a waste of taxpayer money.<br>
<br>
Although this decision should be an easy one for you, I’m sure the fallout will be difficult. The people actively
involved with the Maclay Bridge Alliance feel that you owe them your allegiance and they will be very upset if
you allow the project to continue. Difficult as it may be, I don’t think you have any real option but to move the
project forward. Killing the project would be irresponsible.<br>

<p><u>3. In a Missoulian Guest Editorial, former Commissioner Jean Curtiss states her views on the
South Ave. bridge project:</u></p>

<blockquote>
I attended the Missoula County commissioners&#39; meeting with the Montana Department of Transportation and
Federal Highway Administration &quot;to seek clarity&quot; regarding the Maclay Bridge replacement project, in Helena,
Feb. 13(2019).<br>
<br>
Commissioner Nicole Rowley is very skilled at listening, asking clarifying questions and capturing what is said
succinctly.<br>
<br>
As a new commissioner, Josh Slotnick heard about the project and the process. He asked good questions and
seems anxious to learn more from the consultants the county hired.<br>
<br>
Commissioner Dave Strohmaier said more than once that he didn’t want to &quot;get into the weeds&quot; of the reports
and continued to ask if the county has the authority to stop the South Avenue Bridge alternative, ignoring years
of studies, and instead rehabilitate Maclay Bridge; if the federal dollars can be diverted to Maclay; if the county
can require more environmental studies; and if the county has to pay back the million dollars if they don’t agree
with the professionals.<br>
<br>
I was the commissioner who nominated the bridge to be replaced using the Off-System Bridge Program;
accepted the pre-Montana Environmental Policy Act/National Environmental Policy Act preliminary alternative
for a new South Avenue bridge; signed the agreement to pay back the federal funds if the county stopped the
project without a legitimate reason; with concurrence from both Maclay Bridge Alliance and Maclay Bridge
Coalition (now named Bitterroot Bridges Coalition), hired HDR, a nationally recognized professional firm, to
do the MEPA/NEPA analysis under state and federal rules and regulations to be reviewed by state and federal
agencies; directed HDR to study the cost and scope of a rehab of Maclay Bridge in detail to meet the goals of
the project related to safety, etc.<br>
<br>
I have read the many years of data. The answers are in those &quot;weeds&quot; — decades of research, science and
engineering.<br>
<br>
Elected officials have tough decisions to make and should use the best information available. It may not be the
popular decision but will be the right decision for the good of the whole. When all the independent experts,
from many disciplines, come to the same conclusion from different angles, the decision to be made is pretty
clear.<br>
<br>
It is good that the commission plans to meet with HDR and the county engineer to &quot;get into the weeds&quot; and
understand why they made the recommendation to build a new bridge rather than put bandages on the old one.
An engineer&#39;s stamp on a project reflects their representation of facts, not political influence.<br>
<br>
There is also a 12-month clock running that the commission was counseled is not like football. They can’t run
the clock and say &quot;oh I guess we aren’t building a bridge.&quot; They will be held to the payback clause.
When asked if the South Avenue Bridge is a done deal, Lynn Zanto, MDOT, said yes, unless a significant gap
in the analysis of data is identified.<br>
<br>
In summary, the professionals at the meeting said:<br>
<br>
The environmental analysis is thorough and complete according to MEPA/NEPA.<br>
<br>
If the county chooses to back out of this project, they will be required to pay back the money already spent —
around $1 million.<br>
<br>
The Off-System Bridge Program will not pay for fixing Maclay.<br>
<br>
County taxpayers will have to pay for any additional environmental studies or fixing Maclay.<br>
<br>
This is not a Target Range issue. Previous commissions took their responsibility seriously when they looked for
sources of funds to relieve the local taxpayers of the burden of funding an expensive bridge replacement. The
commission is elected to be good stewards of the tax dollars and the infrastructure. This project does both. You
may contact the commission at bcc@missoulacounty.us.<br>
